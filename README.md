Creating a Java Swing application to generate QR codes involves using the Swing GUI toolkit along with a QR code generation library. In this example, we demonstrate how to create a simple Java Swing application that generates QR codes using the ZXing library.
The developed application is designed to generate a QR code for the message, URL, phone number, text, contact, and email.

## Documentation

[Documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code)

A QR code, short for "Quick Response code," is a two-dimensional matrix barcode that contains information that can be quickly scanned and decoded using a smartphone, QR code reader, or other devices equipped with QR code scanning capabilities. QR codes were first developed in Japan in 1994 by Denso Wave, a subsidiary of Toyota, to track automotive parts during the manufacturing process. Since then, they have gained widespread popularity for a variety of applications due to their efficiency in storing and quickly retrieving information.
