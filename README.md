Creating a Java Swing application to generate QR codes involves using the Swing GUI toolkit along with a QR code generation library. In this example, we demonstrate how to create a simple Java Swing application that generates QR codes using the ZXing library.
The developed application is designed to generate a QR code for URL QR codes, text QR codes, phone number QR codes, SMS QR codes, contact QR codes, and email QR codes..

## How to use it ?
Once you've completed the information, you can save it to a specific drive or location. You can also copy and paste it, for example, in Vcard or a Whatsapp group, or wherever you want.
## Information about QR Code

* [Documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code)

* A QR code, short for "Quick Response code," is a two-dimensional matrix barcode that contains information that can be quickly scanned and decoded using a smartphone, QR code reader, or other devices equipped with QR code scanning capabilities. QR codes were first developed in Japan in 1994 by Denso Wave, a subsidiary of Toyota, to track automotive parts during the manufacturing process. Since then, they have gained widespread popularity for a variety of applications due to their efficiency in storing and quickly retrieving information.
## Main Support Tools

* 1- [zxing] - BarcodeFormat, WriterException, MatrixToImageWriter, BitMatrix, QRCodeWriter (Package)

* 2- [javaswing]  (GUI Framework)

## Inspiration

* [My inspiration for developing this application was www.qrcode-generator.de](https://www.qrcode-generator.de/a1/?gclid=CjwKCAjwoqGnBhAcEiwAwK-OkVemm4nZGvPfmdGBPdNBeN3OuWdMOpw1WO8ni8mKrS8gsLl0rGdKhxoC7hoQAvD_BwE&campaignid=1021196600&adgroupid=52999807645&cpid=da91f623-9ba9-4f2d-b401-2a296129e26b).

* In the next version, I will add all other components as well, like Bitcoin QR Code, MP3 QR Code, WiFi QR Code, and so on.

* Furthermore, I developed URL QR codes, text QR codes, phone number QR codes, SMS QR codes, contact QR codes, and email QR codes.
